Includes catch phrases such as...
- *"Please... I can see the light"*
- *"I need... an outlet"*
- *"Tell Siri I love her"*
- *"My addiction... to current... must be solved."*

Additionally, a number of voice packs are available, with more to be added in the future.

See the `newdesign` branch for progress on the new design. Some ideas are previewed below:


<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
